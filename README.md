------------------
To develop a feasibility study for your 86Visual AI SaaS platform, you’ll need a systematic approach that combines market research, financial forecasting, strategic planning, and operational considerations. The goal is to present a comprehensive report that highlights the potential for growth, market positioning, and risk factors, all while aligning with your target of securing seed funding and scaling your user base.

Below is a Python code template that helps you automate some aspects of the feasibility study process—such as gathering market data, performing financial forecasting, and generating preliminary insights. While this won’t be a complete replacement for human business analysis and research, it can automate parts of the process and assist in gathering necessary data.
Key Steps for Feasibility Study:

    Market Research: Collect and analyze relevant market data.
    Competitive Analysis: Assess existing competitors and their offerings.
    Financial Forecasting: Estimate revenue, costs, and growth potential.
    User Growth Projections: Develop assumptions based on historical data or competitor performance.
    Risk Assessment: Identify risks, including technological and market risks.

Python Code Template for Feasibility Study

Below is an example Python code to help automate market research (gathering data from online sources), financial forecasting (basic revenue prediction), and user growth projection.

import requests
import json
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Market Research - Collect relevant market data (Example: Using a public API for social media market data)
def get_market_data(api_url, params):
    """
    Fetch data from an online market research API (for illustration).
    You can replace this with a custom API call or web scraping.
    """
    response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()  # Return the response data in JSON format
    else:
        return None

# Example market data API URL (e.g., for social media usage statistics)
market_data_url = "https://api.example.com/social_media_data"
params = {
    'region': 'UAE', 
    'categories': 'social_media, content_creation'
}

market_data = get_market_data(market_data_url, params)

# Step 2: Analyze Data - You could analyze key insights (e.g., market size, growth rate, customer preferences)
def analyze_market_data(data):
    # Example of data processing - this would depend on the format of your actual data
    # Let's assume the data contains statistics on market size and growth rate
    if data:
        insights = {
            'market_size': data['market_size'],  # Example: USD 500 million
            'growth_rate': data['growth_rate'],  # Example: 10% annual growth
            'user_trends': data['user_trends']   # Example: rise in demand for AI-driven tools
        }
        return insights
    else:
        return None

market_insights = analyze_market_data(market_data)

# Step 3: Competitive Analysis - Find competitors (for simplicity, using mock data)
def competitive_analysis():
    competitors = {
        'Competitor 1': {'market_share': 0.35, 'service': 'AI Content Creation'},
        'Competitor 2': {'market_share': 0.25, 'service': 'Social Media Automation'},
        'Competitor 3': {'market_share': 0.2, 'service': 'Content Planning Tools'},
        'Competitor 4': {'market_share': 0.2, 'service': 'Content Analytics'}
    }
    return competitors

competitors = competitive_analysis()

# Step 4: Financial Forecasting - Project revenue and costs over time (simple model)
def financial_forecasting(current_revenue, growth_rate, years=5):
    """
    Estimate the future revenue based on an annual growth rate (compounding).
    """
    projected_revenue = {}
    for year in range(1, years + 1):
        future_revenue = current_revenue * (1 + growth_rate) ** year
        projected_revenue[year] = future_revenue
    return projected_revenue

# Example input for financial forecasting
current_revenue = 100000  # USD
growth_rate = 0.2  # 20% annual growth

projected_revenue = financial_forecasting(current_revenue, growth_rate)

# Step 5: User Growth Projection - Linear regression for user base growth
def user_growth_projection(initial_users, growth_rate, years=2):
    """
    Project user growth using a simple linear regression model.
    """
    X = [[i] for i in range(1, years + 1)]  # Year 1, Year 2, etc.
    y = [initial_users * (1 + growth_rate) ** i for i in range(years)]  # Projected users for each year

    model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
    predicted_users = model.predict([[i] for i in range(1, years + 1)])

    return predicted_users

# Example input for user growth projection
initial_users = 500  # initial number of users
growth_rate_users = 0.25  # 25% user growth per year

predicted_users = user_growth_projection(initial_users, growth_rate_users)

# Step 6: Data Visualization (Revenue & User Growth Projections)
def plot_forecasts(projected_revenue, predicted_users):
    years = list(projected_revenue.keys())
    revenue_values = list(projected_revenue.values())
    user_values = predicted_users

    # Plot revenue projections
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    plt.plot(years, revenue_values, marker='o', color='blue', label='Revenue Projections')
    plt.title('Revenue Projections Over Time')
    plt.xlabel('Years')
    plt.ylabel('Revenue (USD)')
    plt.grid(True)

    # Plot user growth projections
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    plt.plot(years, user_values, marker='o', color='green', label='User Growth Projections')
    plt.title('User Growth Projections Over Time')
    plt.xlabel('Years')
    plt.ylabel('Number of Users')
    plt.grid(True)

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

plot_forecasts(projected_revenue, predicted_users)

# Step 7: Compile Feasibility Study Report (Simplified Version)
def compile_feasibility_report(market_insights, competitors, projected_revenue, predicted_users):
    report = {
        'Market Insights': market_insights,
        'Competitive Analysis': competitors,
        'Financial Forecasting': projected_revenue,
        'User Growth Projections': predicted_users
    }
    return report

feasibility_report = compile_feasibility_report(market_insights, competitors, projected_revenue, predicted_users)

# Display the feasibility report
print("\n--- Feasibility Study Report ---\n")
for section, content in feasibility_report.items():
    print(f"\n{section}:")
    print(json.dumps(content, indent=4))

Breakdown of the Code:

    Market Research:
    The get_market_data function fetches market data, which can come from APIs or web scraping tools. The data should ideally provide insights into market size, growth rate, and user trends in your sector. This information is essential for understanding the opportunity size for your platform.

    Competitive Analysis:
    The competitive_analysis function compares your platform against competitors in the space. It assesses market share, features, and service offerings, helping you understand where you stand in the market and identify potential gaps.

    Financial Forecasting:
    The financial_forecasting function projects the financial growth of your platform based on current revenue and a given growth rate. This can be expanded to incorporate costs, margins, and more complex projections.

    User Growth Projection:
    The user_growth_projection uses linear regression to predict how your user base might grow over time based on an initial number of users and an estimated annual growth rate. This will help plan the scale and potential user acquisition strategies.

    Visualization:
    The plot_forecasts function visualizes revenue and user growth projections over time to make your findings more tangible and easier to communicate to stakeholders or investors.

    Feasibility Report:
    Finally, the compile_feasibility_report function compiles all sections of the report into a cohesive document, which you can present to investors, partners, or use for strategic planning.

Next Steps:

    Market Research: Tailor the data collection to the specific UAE market, leveraging local sources or APIs (e.g., government reports, market research databases).
    Competitive Research: Identify key competitors in the AI and SaaS space (such as other social media content automation tools).
    Financials: Refine financial forecasting based on more granular data (like your cost structure and expected revenue model).
    Report Formatting: Once the report is ready, format it professionally using a document tool like Microsoft Word or Google Docs.

This framework can serve as a solid starting point for your feasibility study, but it will require refinement and expert input based on your industry-specific knowledge and the actual data you gather.
